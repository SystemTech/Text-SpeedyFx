    #          '1439817409' => '2',
    #          '3087870273' => '1'
    #        };

    my $feature_vector = $sfx->hash_fv("thats the question", 8);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XS implementation of a very fast combined parser/hasher which works well on a variety of I<bag-of-word> problems.

L<Original implementation|http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2008/HPL-2008-91R1.pdf> is in Java and was adapted for a better Unicode compliance.

=method new([$seed])

Initialize parser/hasher, optionally using a specified C<$seed> (default: 1).

=method hash($string)

Parses C<$string> and returns a hash reference where keys are the hashed tokens and values are their respective count.
Note that this is the slowest form due to the (computational) complexity of the Perl hash structure itself:
C<hash_fv()> is 147% faster, while C<hash_min()> is 175% faster.

=method hash_fv($string, $n)

Parses C<$string> and returns a feature vector (string of bits) with length C<$n>.
C<$n> is supposed to be a multiplier of 8, as the length of the resulting feature vector is C<ceil($n / 8)>.
Feature vector format can be useful in L<Bloom filter|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter> implementation, for instance.

=method hash_min($string)

Parses C<$string> and returns the hash with the lowest value.
Useful in L<MinHash|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash> implementation.
See also the included L<minhash_cmp> utility.
